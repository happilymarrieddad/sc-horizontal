## Change log

**18 July 2015** (v2.3.0)

Renamed all occurrences of 'store' to 'broker' throughout SC (the default file store.js file was also renamed to broker.js).
Since the primary purpose of a 'store' is actually to share messages and data between workers, the word 'broker' seems more appropriate.
You can still save in-memory data inside 'brokers' as before (their functionality hasn't changed - Just the name).

**9 July 2015** (v2.2.38)

The ```store.options``` object from the storeController (store.js) now represents the global options object
(containing all settings passed to the master SocketCluster constructor) instead of just the content of storeOptions.
To pass custom options to the store object, you can just add the directly to the master SocketCluster() constructor's options object. E.g:

```js
var socketCluster = new SocketCluster({
  workers: 1,
  stores: 1,
  // ...
  myCustomBrokerOption: 'bla',
  anotherCustomBrokerOption: 'foo',
  // ...
});
```

This change was also implemented in **sc-redis** although we now use a storeOptions property to hold all store-related properties.
So now, inside the storeController, we access the custom storeOptions property from ```store.options.storeOptions``` - This is for backwards compatibility.
If you ```npm update socketcluster``` just make sure that you also ```npm update sc-redis``` - You shouldn't need to change any of your code.


## Introduction

SocketCluster is a fast, highly scalable HTTP + realtime server engine which lets you build multi-process 
realtime servers that make use of all CPU cores on a machine/instance.
It removes the limitations of having to run your Node.js server as a single thread and makes your backend 
resilient by automatically recovering from worker crashes and aggregating errors into a central log.

## Memory leak profile

SocketCluster has been tested for memory leaks.
The last full memory profiling was done on SocketCluster v0.9.17 (Node.js v0.10.28) and included checks on worker and broker processes.

No memory leaks were detected when using the latest Node.js version.
Note that leaks were found when using Node.js versions below v0.10.22 - This is probably the Node.js 'Walmart' memory leak - Not a SocketCluster issue.

## Installation

There are two ways to install SocketCluster.

### The easy way (Sets up boilerplate - Ready to run):

Setup the socketcluster command:

```bash
npm install -g socketcluster
```

OR 

```bash
sudo npm install -g socketcluster
```

Then

```bash
socketcluster create myapp
```

Once it's installed, go to your new myapp/ directory and launch with:

```bash
node server
```

Access at URL http://localhost:8000/

### The hard way (More modular - Separate server and client):

```bash
npm install socketcluster
```

You will also need to install the client separately which you can get using the following command:

```bash
npm install socketcluster-client
```

The socketcluster-client script is called socketcluster.js (located in the main socketcluster-client directory) 
- You should include it in your HTML page using a &lt;script&gt; tag in order to interact with SocketCluster.
For more details on how to use socketcluster-client, go to https://github.com/SocketCluster/socketcluster-client

It is recommended that you use Node.js version >=0.10.22 due to memory leaks present in older versions.

### Using over HTTPS

In order to run SocketCluster over HTTPS, all you need to do is set the protocol to 'https' and 
provide your private key and certificate as a start option when you instantiate SocketCluster - Example:

```js
var socketCluster = new SocketCluster({
  workers: 3,
  brokers: 3,
  port: 8000,
  appName: 'myapp',
  workerController: 'worker.js',
  protocol: 'https',
  protocolOptions: {
    key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/enc_key.pem', 'utf8'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/cert.pem', 'utf8'),
    passphrase: 'passphase4privkey'
  }
});
```

The protocolOptions option is exactly the same as the one you pass to a standard Node HTTPS server:
